# JavaScript Fundamentals: Master the Basics

This repository contains my progress, exercises, and projects from the **"JavaScript - Master the Fundamentals in 6 Hours"** course by Mosh Hamedani.

The goal of this project was to build a rock-solid foundation in JavaScript (ES6+) by focusing on clean code, logic, and problem-solving.

## Course Overview

This course is a deep dive into the core engine of JavaScript. It moves away from "copy-pasting" and focuses on understanding _how_ the language works under the hood.

**Instructor:** Mosh Hamedani  
**Status:** Completed ✅

- Arithmetic, Assignment, and Comparison operators.
- Equality operators (`==` vs `===`).
- Ternary operators and Logical operators with non-booleans (short-circuiting).

### 3. Control Flow

- Conditional statements (`if...else`, `switch...case`).
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...in`, and `for...of`.
- **Exercises:** FizzBuzz, Max of Two Numbers, Demerit Points calculator, etc.

### 4. Objects

- Creating objects using Literals, Factory Functions, and Constructor Functions.
- Dynamic nature of objects and the `this` keyword.
- Value vs. Reference types.

### 5. Arrays

- Adding, removing, and finding elements.
- Arrow functions.
- Powerful array methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `sort`.
